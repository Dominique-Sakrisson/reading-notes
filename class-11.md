# Chapter 16 HTML IMAGES

In this chapter it covered images, their html tags and css styling options. Images can be alligned in various ways, when set as the background color imagine a 3X3 grid that is the parent elements.
We can specify `top-middle` for the middle column and top row. or `Middle-right` for the right side column in the 2nd row, etc. When using some buttons and links we can set 3 different rules based on the link status
One for hovering, one for regular and one for active (clicked).If an element background image has a high contrast it technically isnt very good for a background image, the high contrast makes whatever text is on top of the element very hard to read.
EIther use low contrast images or a 'screen' background can be set above the image but below the text node.

There are seven essential places where you want your keywords to appear. Ensuring images have proper text for their `alt=''` attribute is also helpful.

Off page techniques apply to things like other sites that link to yours. How relavant is the content of those sites to yours. The more alike they are to your site the better the seo rating for those links will be. 

The 7 locations of keywords for your site.
1. Page Title
2. URL/web address
3. Headings `<h> tags`
4. Text- where possible it helps to include the keywords 2-3 times. 
5. link text - use keywords in the link text instead of generic 'click heres' 
6. Image alt text- alt text will help your images show up in related image searches which users can link back to your site with
7. Page Descriptions - including keywords inside the meta tags will also help out. Dont try to trick a search engine , it will not work. Doing things such as keywords in the same color as the 
background makes them 'hidden' from the user but not the search engine. You will be penalized for it in seo score.

Refine- prioritize the words that are most descriptive and relevant to your site, even if they are high competition.

Each of your page should have 3-5 keywords that you can focus on. The furtther away from the homepage in your site, the more specific keywords should be for that page. 

Analytics- tools such as good analytics will give you real time information on the users of your site, where they came from, how they got there, time spent on your site etc,
