The article on google project artemis was super interesting to me, and of course leave it to google to be the ones using data to try and form human emotions and productivity into being just more data points to work with.
I feel like chopping human needs down to data is sort of dehumanizing in a round about way. Though the process of what they did seems to make us all be robots if the findings allow for people to actually feel good about their work, this can all probably be chalked up to a 'win'.
The patterns they found make alot of sense to me when I think back to past group work I've been apart of. If everyone was having a good time, spirits are higher and people seem more apt to collaborate. However if the opposite was true, productivity seems to drop pretty bad. 
For example I was the new guy working in a retail environment and come to find out that 4/5 disliked the manager. 
Employees regularly essentially colluded against this guy in their work habits, I saw just how unproductive things can become. Along with the overall toxic nature that can
come out of that. I did not ever feel good coming to work, constantly at odds with telling everyone else to chill out cause the boss wasn't a bad manager in my opinion at all.
Needless to say, during this time that location in particular was the problem child of the entire territory. I can see how being in a group setting where one isn't comfortable
with speaking their mind can inhibit the path of progress, similarly if one particular person is too comfortable with their opinion, fueled with charisma and white knuckles 
can direct the group down a path that probably isn't the best option. Again super interesting read!

As for all the CSS snippets and the instruction on animations, I have bookmarked them all for future reference I had assumed until now, most of that styling was something a person would need to use Js for.
